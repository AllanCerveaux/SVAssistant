# Stardew Valley Assistant

> Disclaimer: I'm still learning donet and C#, so developing this mod allows me to experiment, and the code will certainly not follow certain conventions imposed by the language/framwork.

**SVAssistant** is a plugin that converts information from the **Stardew Valley** game into an APIRest that can be consumed by different applications..

## Requirements

- `Stardew Valley`: `1.6>`
- `dotnet`: `Net6.0`
- `SMAPI`: `4.1.1`

## Objective

My goal is to create an API Rest (see Websocket for multiplayer), to consume it via a website.
For the moment, I don't have any specific ideas, but I'd like to create an interactive Wiki with the game.
